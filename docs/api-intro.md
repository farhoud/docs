# FULA API

The FULA API was designed by us for us with the intention that you (a third party open source developer) will be able to leverage it in order to build other compelling/rich user experiences.

Head over to [getting started](./getting-started) if you want to get your hands dirty right away or skip straight to the [reference](./reference-api) if you are the type of person that reads the entire car manual before operation.
